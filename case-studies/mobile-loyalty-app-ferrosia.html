                <h3 class="" >THE CLIENT</h3>
                <p class="">For about 7 years, the customer has culminated robust business applications in the development of computer software. Our client identified a shortcoming in their current offerings through their experiences with companies of all kinds and decided that they needed to outsource to bridge the gap. 
                       <p> With a loyalty application development project, the customer approached Ferrosia, an application with mobile compatibility that allowed customers to earn rewords from their daily purchases. We wanted to target high traffic demands and receive the greatest amount of incentives for their clients. To do this, the customer envisaged a loyalty app that would track gas station, grocery store, and other ordinary retail purchases.
                        </p> Essentially, as a business marketing tool, the loyalty application would double, allowing businesses to promote themselves, trade deals and special pricing in exchange for brand loyalty.</p>

                        <h3 class="" >MOBILE LOYALTY APP DOUBLES AS MARKETING TOOL</h3>
                        <p class="">After vetting the project, Ferrosia determined that the application required a portal for consumers to register and log in. Additionally, it needed to have a feature to search for businesses. After successfully finding businesses in the search menu, customers would have the ability to take a picture of their receipt and upload it to the app in order to collect reward points for their loyalty. 
                               <p> To conquer the administrator maintenance, Ferrosia designed a back end office for the app owners where they could add and remove new businesses, modify client subscriptions, review and validate consumer receipts, and allocate the customer reward points based on amount spent. </p> 
                               The back office would be compartmentalized so that business owners also had their own platform to implement additional deals for customers to use in exchange for their loyalty points, marking off promotions as they were claimed to prevent repeat use. 
                              <p> Finally, Ferrosia would integrate the payment gateway in order for businesses to be able to pay the monthly fees associated with the loyalty application to promote themselves.</p>

                            <p class="">Throughout the partnerships, Ferrosia worked closely with the company so that as the development context grew, the product stayed well within the previously planned plan. The following innovations were introduced by Ferrosia to mimic a more common consumer web app that the customer wanted to use as an influence for the design: 
                              
                                    <ul>
                                            <li>PhoneGap tool to convert a web application to a natively installed hybrid mobile app with device level support for iPhone 10/11, iPad Mini, Android Tablet (all resolution), Android Phones (all resolutions) and across multiple browsers
                                                </li>
                                            <li>WFC was used to ensure that receipt images were optimized</li>
                                            <li>Integrating Facebook API for an app that utilized a hybrid language</li>
                                            <li>Tripe payment gateway was also implemented to the web app in order for businesses to make payments for registering on the app
                                                </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Finally, Ferrosia provided a deliverable with all the expected features, fulfilling the customer's need for user-friendly applications which customers can access from the app store, turn to locate their preferred stores, and submit their receipts to start earning bonuses. 
                                  <p> The finished app features a convenient log-in screen connecting to Facebook, linking user profiles to their app accounts for a quicker process of registration. Customers can earn rewards from the app for shopping at the companies they already frequent.  </p> 
                                  The monthly fees from businesses associated with the company were handled by an automated payment gateway on the web application.
                            </p>
