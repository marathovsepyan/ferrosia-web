                        <p class="">Because the application was designed to handle large sums of money, secure and certifiable software development was paramount to the future of their firm. Chetu sought to develop software cohesive to the client's preexisting model, streamlining their image across platforms. The Chetu approach resulted in an application that satisfied the real estate company's need for a...

                        <p class="">Chetu, a certified software development company with vast experience developing and integrating custom software, assisted the client and transitioned their vision into a highly intelligent application.
                                Chetu utilized the following technologies to transform the client’s concept to code…
                          <ul>
                            <li> .NET</li>
                            <li>MS SQL Server 2008 R2</li> 
                                The final deliverable allowed users to define their roles within the system, essentially maintaining a user management system for administrators to access in real-time. In leveraging this system our client developed a department hierarchy from which they could assign and access reports according to department.
                                In addition, the application includes a G&A management module. Chetu implemented an online template to facilitate the upload and review of expense reports. Users are able to manually input this data or upload a predefined excel sheet. All data is then transmitted to the planning department where multiple approvers can review or approve G&A budgets at various levels.
                                All users have the capacity to create projects and submit them for approval, while the P&L reporting module tracks the expenditure from each storefront.
                                Overall, Chetu matched the client with a robust store-level budgeting application solution tailored to their individual business climate. The application provided the perfect platform for greater ROI and stable spending habits across the client’s network of stores.
