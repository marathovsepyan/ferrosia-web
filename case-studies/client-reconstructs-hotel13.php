                        <p class="">The objective of the client's project was to create an Android application for SIP calling. The client wanted to replace/remove the need for hotel guest room phones with this Android app. The application needed to be able to identify a person's current latitude and longitude and have a feature for an individual to input a specific PIN to connect to the appropriate servers. Once connected, the user would have to register with the server to receive a unique user ID that can be reused to make and receive calls on the app.
                                To client also envisioned the app to have speed dial buttons to make direct calls to hotel services, including room service, maintenance, the front desk, the spa and more. Being designed as an app for a mobile device, the product would ensure that guests have the capability to make and receive calls for hotel services anywhere on the hotel premises.

                            <h3 class="text-center" >MAXIMIZING HOTEL STAFF & GUEST ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
                            <p class="">To transition their product concept into a working solution, the client reached out to Chetu, a certified software development company with extensive experience developing and integrating custom hospitality software. Chetu utilized the following technologies:                                  
                                    <ul>
                                            <li>SQL Lite database</li>
                                            <li>Java programming language</li>
                                            <li>SVN source control tool to create an app for SIP calling</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Chetu's robust deliverable has defined user ID's and PINs for guests to easily register on the app's server and connect to their hotel. This application is accessible from the Android App Store so that users can download the app to their mobile device at the touch of a button.
                                    To cater to a variety of guests and services, the SIP calling app features a highly intuitive user interface with various hotel amenities on speed dial for quick and convenient service. Alternatively, the app is well tailored to the service provider, granting hotel staff greater accessibility and allowing them to reach guests from anywhere on the property.
