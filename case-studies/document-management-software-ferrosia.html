                <h2 class="" >THE CLIENT | DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SUPERPOWER</h2>
                <p class="">The client is offering an online service that permits its audience to control and operate their business and personal assets safely through Amazon cloud, maintaining accessibility from multiple places with absolutely free of cost connectivity and functioning. Furthermore, they facilitate their audience with a document management software, and the automation of manual record-keeping practices to give them relieve from everyday hassles.
                   <p>It’s a fact that the UI/UX can either can be the be-all and end-all of a service, regardless of what a brand is offering in terms of products and services, clients consistently decline brands due to their poor end-user performance. The client has specified our development services after finding a delay in website management and operations; their main task was to optimize their front-end in a manner that their backend document management software works and supports it in a parallel manner. The client took us on board to plan and design an attractive UX relevant to their brand identity, an eye-catching plan and customer retaining strategy.

                   </p> 
                    Before initiating every requirement and specification was brought under discussion to make things clear. We collectively agreed to utilize Drupal 7 as it is the most constant form available in the market and also possesses a large community following. Drupal 7 offers a comprehensive developer toolbox that consist of inbuilt modules for payments, subscriptions and email campaigns. It gives us the access to modify third party extensions as per the requirements of our client.

                        <p class="">The signed up members enjoy a list of facilities and tap into the site’s exclusive services. A sign up is required for setting up a profile, where an individual profile is created for the member. The clients are given access to their document management software by becoming members. They create new items and upload media, customize their categorization, access documents they uploaded previously, manage their updates and their membership plans.
                            <p>  Administrators are supervised by senior administrators. When they receive permission administrators unlock a new layer of the website. From the administrator’s account, they manage content on the webpages for front-end maintenance, allocating information on the FAQ	and other landing pages. They are also given access of editing membership plans and export user data into Excel, PDF, or CV’s. The website also offers administrators with a number of user trends, instructing the client’s strategy of moving forward. The front-end automatically updates once the administrators finalize alterations.  </p>
                            The project produces a powerful document management system, driven by a modern front-end. We required the UX to be as clean as possible, directing users to their specified services. The key aspects are on the homepage that consist of the sign up option, and after that there are three navigation buttons-your information, organized, and kept in the cloud-the parts that receive the most traffic. 
                            When a member logs into their profile, they get a personalized dashboard that displays the folders and subcategories that they create for themselves. They can easily shift between documents and reorganize the data as they please. Summing up all, we have developed a highly spontaneous document management software that adjust according to their users need.

                        <p class="">The vision of client is dependent on a complex list of programming requirements, which were beyond the basic requirements. We were required to create a website that can be used to sign up and upload their assets in the form of graphics and documents.
                          <p> To manage the moving parts, we developed a user hierarchy, allotting users into members, administrators and senior administrators. The administrators manage the subscriptions of members and they also have an access to make system modifications, organizing the fields on different forms. All documents are going to be stored on Amazon.
                          </p>
                            During the development process we employed the mentioned technologies
                            
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Language: PHP 7.2</li>
                                        <li>Database: MySQL 5.7</li>
                                        <li>Web Server: Apache 2.0</li>
                                        <li>CMS- Drupal 7.56</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript Library: JQuery 3.3.1</li>
                                        <li>Markup: HTML 5 with Atomic pattern</li>
                                        <li>Version Control: SVN</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    All client ventures initiate with account management. Random audience often turns into members by signing up through a precise registration form. The registration form stimulates users to fill out their basic information such as username, email, password type and notifications. All facilitations are mentioned within the content of the homepage.
