                        <p class="">The client wanted to develop a cross-platform application for iOS and Android handheld devices that would allow food distributors across the US and Canada to streamline their operations. The main mission was to deliver pickers with an application that would allow them to operate more efficiently, easing the sales order and bar code scanning processes.</p>
                              <p>  Engineering the application to accurately read barcodes was a project imperative; including this functionality ensures accurate traceability. Customers would have the means to access data about a service, and suppliers would be informed of their order status throughout the entire supply chain cycle. 
                               <p> The client had envisioned an application that facilitated a more automated warehouse environment. At the client's request, the application also needed to be able to perform certain jobs functions for the allocation and/or non-allocation of orders, lost control, and catch weight items. </p>
                                It was of paramount importance that the application could help pickers identify already allocated and non-allocated orders, as well as a combination of the two where only some items were allocated. Using this method, at the time of choosing, pickers can determine a lot (or validate the lot if pre-allocated). In addition, the lot control feature needed to have an option to turn off if operations in a warehouse do not require lots tracking in order to simplify the picking process. The feature of catch weight items would use weight bar codes to quickly process items.
