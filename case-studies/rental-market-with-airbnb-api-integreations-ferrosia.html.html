                <h2 class="" >AIRBNB│VACATION RENTAL POWERHOUSE</h2>
                <p class="">Airbnb has taken the holiday rental world by storm, encouraging property owners to post their rental deals and to communicate directly with clients involved in their choice. The most persuasive feature of this system is its ease of use, both from the viewpoint of owner and tenant.  Just input your arrival and departure dates, your preferred venue, and these parameters return all the properties that are valuable to you.
                <p>There is also a range of search preferences to choose from apart from time and venues, varying from property type and on-site storage to pet friendliness, along with at least twenty others. You choose the things without which you can't live and Airbnb is doing the job for you.</p> 
                        In fact, Airbnb is the dawn of a new era in hospitality, an online marketplace where vendors and customers work together to express themselves. Today, Airbnb's collection contains more than 4 million rentals globally, and to date has managed at least 260 million short-term stays. Considering Airbnb's immense success during its 9 years of service, it was no wonder that Ferrosia started receiving applications for Airbnb integration.

                        <h2 class=""> BI-DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NATIVE SITE AND AIRBNB    </h2>
                        <p class="">In general, one customer planned to maximize their access to rental property by 
                            establishing a direct line of bi-directional contact between the pre-existing site of the company 
                            and Airbnb.
                               <p> Ferrosia developed a project plan outlining the demands of the client; in turn, they were 
                                   intended to create a low burden connection between the two parties. Inventory-related 
                                   information will flow in real time through this portal, including details such as quality, 
                                   prices, and property descriptions.
                                </p>
                                    Once renters via Airbnb demanded a house, the information would then filter back through their native framework, providing a single set of data. Next, Ferrosia recognized the need for a custom Web API to transfer data between the programs. The following details to be accepted for transition was identified by the client:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Property List</li>
                                    <li>Property Detail</li>
                                    <li>Property Pics</li>
                                    <li>Property Availability</li>
                                    <li>Property Rate</li>
                                </ul>
                                An implementation of an Airbnb API would then return the details of the reservation to the 
                                native system. Inventory retrieval was also included in the preliminary process, ensuring 
                                accurate display of the data at hand between the sites.

                            <p class="">During the development process Chetu deployed the following technologies…
                                   <ul>
                                       <li>VS 2017</li>
                                       <li>SQL Server 2012</li>
                                       <li>.Net Framework [4.5.1]</li>
                                       <li>C#</li>
                                       <li>Web API</li>
                                       <li>Log4net – For logging and tracing in application.</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   Using those combined technologies Chetu built a 3-tier system comprised of a Web API layer, Business Tier, and Data Tier. The Web API is the top layer of the application and exists as a filter. The Business Tier receives any requests from the Web API layer, processes them, and then communicates with the data layer. The Data Tier is responsible for communication with the client's database following the requests received from the Web and Business Tiers.
                                   Chetu chose two libraries to leverage within the project, Elmah and Log4net. Elmah was implemented to capture all the rental exceptions and display user-friendly messages regarding the exceptions within the UI. Log4net was used for logging and tracing information, warnings, and errors.
                                   Chetu formulated a deliverable for the client that had the dual-functionality they desired, preserving the integrity of their legacy system while reaping the benefits of Airbnb's global consumer following.
