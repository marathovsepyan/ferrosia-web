                <h2 class="" >AN EVER-CHANGING RETAIL FRONT</h2>
                <p class="">The customer is an established retail company responsible for high-end furniture distribution. We continue to develop their long-term relationships with factories in Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and China, exploiting over 32 years of experience, allowing them to produce consumer products at competitive prices without sacrificing quality.</p>
                  <p>  The company has preserved a competitive advantage to locations around the globe by establishing a commanding presence in e-commerce. Failure to keep up with technological developments in such a saturated market can weigh heavily on ROI, cost potential sales, and lose brand loyalty.

                        <p class="">The customer built up their prior site utilizing the Magento web based business stage with PHP as the language and MySQL as the dynamic database. They mentioned that Ferrosia redevelop their internet business website, redoing the obsolete highlights and programming a progression of improvements. In particular, the customer tried to advance the UI and client experience (UI/UX), in addition to improve the responsiveness for cell phones. </p>
                           <p> The directions that connected the Magento web application and the customer's stock database were written in database content that was inclined to execution issues. The customer kept their stock administration framework separate from their web application, a divided framework that sustained wasteful aspects and caused inconsistencies between client buys and items in-stock. To cross over any barrier, the customer needed to incorporate their stock framework with their site, binding together the framework.

                            <p class="">Chetu dramatically improved the UI/UX of the client's website by establishing an efficient, one-page checkout process by integrating the USAePay payment gateway into the Magento e-commerce site.
                                    In addition, Chetu bridged the site and their inventory database using a middleware called eBridge, which is used to automate the bi-directional exchange of data. This enhancement gave sales representatives the capability to create quotes for their customers by adding the product and price information to the shopping cart.
                                    The client's administrators could now manage products with back-end accessibility and complete project functions such as:
