                <p class="">The client is a UK marketplace with a buyer-driven model that helps buyers find the most competitive prices online. Using the clients website, the buyer has to do minimal research to get their desired product at the lowest possible market price. As the marketplace has grown in success there was an opportunity for expansion. The client chose Chetu's ecommerce development experts to get the job done.
                        The client requested we expand the availability of their marketplace by developing a plugin available to popular ecommerce platforms like BigCommerce. The client specifically wanted to build shopping cart plug-ins that will consume the client's RESTful API and allow online retailers to access the most competitive market prices of the products they are selling. Online retailers will be able to leverage the clients pricing data and better compete within their industry.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">Our team of ecommerce developers created a web-application hosted in an iframe to be installed as a BigCommerce app for pushing inventories. The inventories list will be displayed to the online retailer which he can select and send. The plugin was organized by list of inventories, flag the inventories, send. The plugin will updates prices and stock, read and push orders, and log any errors during upload.
                                The four main steps to creating the Plugin:
                                Create package/extension for the ecommerce platform
                                <ol>
                                        <li>Let Merchant send their Inventory data</li>
                                        <li>Updates on Price and Stock (as real time as possible)</li>
                                        <li>rder updates to the Merchant ecommerce site.</li>
                                        <li>The technologies used are CakePHP, Silex, MySQL Database and SVN Repository.</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript Library: JQuery 3.3.1</li>
                                        <li>Markup: HTML 5 with Atomic pattern</li>
                                        <li>Version Control: SVN</li>
                                </ol>
                                The team ensured error reporting and user displayed messages, rules for inbuilt functions, arrays, variables, constants, strings, functions, classes, docblock formatting were all functioning in unision with BigCommerce.
