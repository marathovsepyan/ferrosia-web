                <p class="">Our company runs a broad delivery network in South Florida, offering standard car, truck and motorized transport services to recreational vehicles. The customer used a standard transportation management system (TMS) before engaging with Ferrosia, which functioned as a control hub for operations management and payment exchanges. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, their TMS was operating inefficiently and retrofitting was required. Their current system did not adequately reflect the quality of service provided by the client and sought a more functional system to foster the growth of the company.

                        <p class=""> <b> The Problem:</b> <br>
                                There was extreme disjunction between the various channels and points of interaction, obstructing information access and storage plus hindering cross-channel functionality. The web application was the most debilitating facet, as it was not correctly integrated with their back office accounting software.
                                The ultimate goal was to seamlessly integrate their platforms together so that all employees and carriers experienced a uniform interface allowing users to obtain and input accurate information.

                            <p class="">This undertaking is ongoing, existing as an ongoing effort to maximize functionality in a way that outfits the operation of the client.

                                 <br> <b>Technologies Implemented:</b>  <br>
                                   A combination of PHP CORE (Custom MVC), JavaScript, and QuickBooks were utilized in this project.
                                  <br> <b> The Process: </b><br>
                                   To fix existing accounting errors Ferrosia developers... 
                            <ul>
                                <li> Developed a platform to allow the transition of accurate information to QuickBooks, ensuring improved reliability</li>
                                <li>Optimized loading time of the server to increase the efficiency of the request </li> 
                                <li>Pre-examination of emerging technology to insure that entry bugs are avoided during process overhaul. </li> 
                              </ul>
                               <b> THE IMPACT :</b> <br>
                               Generally, the TMS worked more efficiently and cohesively. There was a drop in load times in the server, which streamlined UX. Ferrosia set up advanced search functions that made it easier for users to search for carriers, shippers, customers and locations. Overall, the client left with intelligent technology that simplified their existing system, allowing customer and carriers to connect more efficiently.
