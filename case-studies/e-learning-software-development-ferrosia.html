                        <p class="">During the beginning of the collaboration between customers and Ferrosia, the need for their e-learning service grew and the need for an updated data monitoring system became important. Our group recommended that they generate a sales report by adding information for streamlined sales data reporting from their Moodle application to the Magento Enterprise system. The consumer accepted and ordered the sales report to gather sales data, payment methods, and configurable values of tailored transactions, store data in a modified server, and generate sales reports capturing Magento data, as well as their own site.
                                Magento data tracking and order management capabilities make it much easier for customers to have an exceptional shopping experience by selling product inventory. It also allows you to quickly adapt to changing customer demands and helps identify best-selling products to ensure that they are always available for purchase by customers. Customer expectations increase by the day, which is why Magento is one of the top platforms helping e-commerce business stay ahead of their competitors.

                            <h2 class="" >FERROSIA DEVELOPS THE MAGENTO WEB SERVICE SOLUTION </h2>
                            <p class="">The following methods were used by Ferrosia to carry the customer's vision from concept to code:     
                                   <ul>
                                       <li>Linux</li>
                                       <li>Apache 2.2</li>
                                       <li>SQL Server</li>
                                       <li>PHP 5.3</li>
                                       <li>C++</li>
                                       <li>GIT (Versioning control system)</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   
                                   
                                   Ferrosia started by strategizing the organization of the customer's sales report solution. Ferrosia would have two menu options: a page of configuration and a screen of report view. The configuration page was broken down into Basic Configuration, Payment Configuration, and Mapping Site License.
                                    <ul>
                                            <li><b>Basic Configuration:</b> Basic configuration page will be used to save static text values, storage API selection and scheduler time selection.                                </li>
                                            <li><b>Payment Configuration:</b>Payment configuration page will provide the functionality to assign AHI payment code to the payments methods coming from Magento payment API.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><b>Site License Mapping: </b>Site license mapping will be used for the root site license mapping.
                                     </ul>
                                     <p>  The View Report monitor will have a list of all the information created by the documents, and the client may access any of them.</p>
                                    <p> Ferrosia extended the Moodle (PHP) clients platform with Magento's web service as far as functionality is concerned. Our developers have registered the customer with Magento web service in XML-RPC to collect the sales data. The data report parameters were "order identification" and "credit memo identification." </p> <p>
                                     Web service records all invoice records larger than the' Order ID' and refunds all credit memo records larger than the' Credit Memo ID.' The same was done to capture all of Magento's active payment methods. The configuration screen will facilitate the admin user to save configurable values for the targeted report, Magento payment methods "ahip code," and Site license mapping.<p>
                                     <p>The setup page as described above provides the admin consumer with an interface to store field values. All field values are associated with a default value, and the default value can be overridden by the data entered by the user. </p> 
                                     Moodle will get the answer back from the web service of Magento and save the information in the server. Ferrosia created new database tables using MySQL. 
                                    <p> The customer left an interactive deliverable inventory monitoring system for readability and usability of information. Their updated platform now has the capacities to handle a large influx of sales data as they continue to grow their e-learn business.
