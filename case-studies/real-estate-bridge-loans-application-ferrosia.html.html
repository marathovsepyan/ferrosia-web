                        <p class="">While their functional bridge loan system worked well, technical complexity was missing. The client of Ferrosia claimed that the design of software would optimize productivity and give users greater power over the following processes:

                            <li> Proposal plan creation</li>
                            <li>Investor selection</li> 
                            <li>Calculation of the projected investment costs</li> 
                            <li>Secretarial duties (legal paperwork and electronically signed documents)</li>
                            <li>Reporting features</li>
                            <li>Display dashboard for graphs and pie charts</li>

                        <p class="">Because the application was designed to handle large sums of money, software development that was secure and certifiable was paramount to their company's future. Ferrosia sought to develop cohesive software that would streamline their image across platforms to the pre-existing model of the client. The solution to Ferrosia culminated in an implementation that fulfilled the need for a...
                           <ul>
                                <li> User-friendly application that allows fundraisers and borrowers to create multiple portfolios and cases.  </li>
                                <li>Management system for important documentation and providing a means to aggregate data into detailed reports. </li> 
                                <li>Channel for soliciting with investors, as well as manually sorting / hand picking investors and assigning them to specific cases based on their contributions.   </li> 
                                <li>Progress bar to display the total amount raised so far and how many more days left to raise and achieve the target.  </li>
                                <li>Integration to an EBPP platform for ACH/credit cardÂ   </li>
                            </ul>
                                </p>
                                The partnership of Ferrosia concluded with a custom bridge loan application that significantly improved the internal processes of our customer-another success of Ferrosia.
