                <p class="">In-spite of your income stream strength or workforce scale, some processes will remain a potential issue. Throughout the system, the bad thing businesses continue to meet: payroll. Eventually, a person (or persons) is waiting to be compensated for their work. Our client provides services to companies that need payroll data entry, serving as an intermediary in the storage and recovery process of data entry. Since then they have escalated into a major payroll system supplier, going far beyond manual data entry to relieve the payroll cycle pressure. The customer now matches its customers with the facilities needed to securely process complex calculations and workforce analytics, taking all discretionary steps to protect the confidentiality of the employee. The customer used Kronos technology, a powerful workforce management and cloud software solution for Human Capital Management to further manage and facilitate the needs of employees. The cloud emergence existed as a tipping point for the company, becoming the revolutionary storage platform they needed to introduce their solutions to a higher payroll processing level. The customer transitioned from service provider to product seller after participating in a cloud system beta test.

                        <p class="">The customer was on a two-part mission: developing a service that links third party systems, starting with a small group of applications and optimizing, and locating a development company capable of engineering the multi-tenant application at a reasonable cost. They just needed to match the coding bandwidth when the client came to Ferrosia, they already had a finalized vision. The project's goal was to create an interface that would communicate with the Kronos program, capable of collecting data on a single employer and storing the data in the server. Ferrosia's developers intended to implement a Kronos integration that was critical to the customer because of the Kronos system's importance in assisting to directly derive files and inbuilt information from the application to be developed. Within this integrated application, Ferrosia used the Kronos system to create an action where new employees incorporated to the system that can also dispatch their information to another third-party human capital management system called Poster Elite. This unified software provided client control, manager management, reporting characteristics, mapping and a company organization data generation schedule. Ferrosiaâ€™s developers intended to implement a Kronos integration that was critical to the customer because of the Kronos system's importance in assisting to directly derive files and inbuilt information from the application to be developed. The software would also create files for government revenue systems in compilation with the data collected from the third-party system. The HCM software of the client unifies a variety of features: time and attendance, HRIS software, tracking and reporting of ACA, plus payroll services.

                            <p class="">In order to integrate third-party information in XML format, Ferrosia needed to create an interface that would enable the user to handle and auto produce sales and payroll files directly from the Kronos platform. The software encourages users to log into the program on a monthly basis, handling service members, contractor information, and state revenue files per consumer.
                                      <p> During this venture, Ferrosia used the following technology...</p>

                                        The final deliverable extended beyond the original project requirements of the customer, providing a highly intuitive multi-tenant application for their operations. Admin has the ability to create new users from the application, which can then log into the system at their own discretion. Managers may access a database of all consumers, export or connect customers directly from the software to the third party network. As far as revenue service file management is concerned, managers are able to take the following actions...
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Downloading XML files for each employer (Client) per month basis.  </li>
                                            <li>Modifying attribute name and mapping of source (third-party) and target revenue service application.</li>
                                            <li>Creating and generating XML files for any employer on ad-hoc basis</li>
                                            In addition, incorporating and integrating Kronos software solutions into the system is able to provide a range of HCM resources such as accounting, time and availability, absentee control, and planning to help customers handle their workplace demands on a flexible cloud platform framework. The multi-tenant software increased inner efficiencies by zooming out onto the larger picture. The consumer no longer needed workers to print UPS shipping labels manually. This greatly improved information reliability, so that it was no longer subject to human error. The creation of Ferrosia has laid the foundation for a new service that the consumer is preparing to launch, significantly improving ROI.
